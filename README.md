## About [fastMRI](https://fastmri.org/)
> Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) by acquiring fewer measurements has the potential to reduce medical costs, minimize stress to patients and make MR imaging possible in applications where it is currently prohibitively slow or expensive.
>
> fastMRI is a collaborative research project between Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and NYU Langone Health. The aim is to investigate the use of AI to make MRI scans up to 10 times faster.
>
> To enable the broader research community to participate in this important project, NYU Langone Health has released fully anonymized raw data and image datasets.
